# Image Steganography for passwords

The word Steganography is derived from two Greek words- â€˜stegosâ€™ meaning â€˜to coverâ€™ and â€˜grayfiaâ€™, meaning â€˜writingâ€™, thus translating to â€˜covered writingâ€™, or â€˜hidden writingâ€™.

Pretty sure y'all have seen some fancy password managers. 
Now get ready for another one of the fanciest one on the internet, _Stegos Grayfia_ (ik it sounds like a harry potter spell lol).
